This script allows you to optimize top shelf coverage in Mario Kart tour. It models the problem as a set covering problem and find the global optima(s) through linear programming.

By adjusting the parameters on main.py you can:

* find the least ammount of drivers you need to have complete coverage 
* using your own inventory as input from the raw.xlsx file, find which drivers to invest into, to achieve maximum coverage while spending the least amount of tickets

Below you will find each parameter and its effect on the model:
